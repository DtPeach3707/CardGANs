# Card GANs

This project is to make an image of one of the four card suits

Uses both CGAN and DCGAN architectures, and with DCGAN a latent space graph is provided of how the 2-dimensional latent space influences the type of suit the card generates.

Google Drive Dataset I used is from this paper:
1. Ziatdinov, M.; Kalinin, S. V., Enter the j(r)VAE: divide, (rotate), and order... the cards. 
Towards data Science. 2021. https://towardsdatascience.com/enter-the-j-r-vae-divide-rotate-and-order-the-cards-9d10c6633726
